							<p>Hello and welcome to my Portfolio. In here you will find all of my projects that I have created. I am a Sophmore at Arizona State University, I am studying for my bachelor degree in Software Engineering.
								My passion is game development, like most game devs my story started in my younger years. Playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Duck Hunt on the NES, later moving to Super Mario Bros. and Mortal Kombat on SNES.
							After that it was the era of the playstation one playing Crash Bandicoot and Need For Speed. These early games just intrigued me and I played for hours. Like most kids I always wanted to make my dream of creating games a reality.
						now some years later I am making that dream into reality.    </p>
							<p>I never really played many games on PC other than Doom. It wasnt until recent years that I became more active in PC games. Along with this my spark of creating games began to flourish again and I decided to take action. 
								I have been studying game development for almost two years in both Unity and Unreal. Along with studying Java in school and expanding my understanding of programming further. Alot of my projects like most may seem unfinished, 
								but to me they are stepping stones for overcoming boulders. I have competed in the Ludum Dare Game Jam, I have also taken many courses online for game development along with standard programming courses. I have recently expanded my 
								interest also to game assets and level design using Blender and Maya. I plan to have a page for those up and running soon. Please feel free to look at all of my projects and shoot me a email if you have any question or concerns.
